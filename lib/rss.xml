 <br><br>A single day on Caitha is roughly the same length as one on Earth. Time is being tracked throughout the day using a combination of sun-positioning, stable candles, water clocks, other mechanical or magical means and - depending on where you live - even using the weather.<br>
Mechanical clocks are technically available, though scarce, not very practical, and incredibly expensive.<br><br>The most widely adapted and established Calendar in Caitha is the <a data-href="Druidic Calendar" href="\Druidic Calendar" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Druidic Calendar</a> - a lunar calendar based on the moon phases of two out of the three <a data-href="Moons" href="\Moons" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Moons</a> of Caitha, Elydd, Nevi and Yova, developed by Druids in today's <a data-href="Ilora" href="\Ilora" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ilora</a> based on their observance of the night sky and the seasons.<br>
This Calendar was later adopted and spread through the world through trade and politics by the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Palyra" data-href="Palyra" href="\Palyra" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Palyran Empire</a> during the <a data-href="Era of Legends" href="\timelines\era-of-legends.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Era of Legends</a>. The beginning of this calendar is marked by the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="The Druidic Sacrifice" data-href="The Druidic Sacrifice" href="\events\the-druidic-sacrifice.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Druidic Sacrifice</a>.<br><br>The week is made up of 8 days and based on the blue moon Nevi, which takes 16 days for a full cycle. Every week starts on either a full moon or a new moon on Moonday and goes over firsday, seconday, thirday, fourday, fiveday, sixday, and sevenday.<br><br>A Month on Caitha is made up of 37 days and is based on the white moon Elydd, which takes a full 74 days for a full cycle.  Each new moon for Elydd roughly marks the beginning of a new season.<br>First Bloom<br>
First month of the year, and the arrival of spring. This month celebrates the blossoming of the flora.<br>Goldengrass<br>
Second month of the year, as the sun becomes more intense, this month is marked by an increase in sunlight and warmth leading into summer.<br>Emberfall<br>
Third month of the year, marked by occasional wildfires and dry season in <a data-href="Palyra" href="\Palyra" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Palyra</a>.<br>First Harvest<br>
Fourth month of the year, named after the first harvest that occurs.<br>Seawind<br>
Fifth month of the year, as the winds off the sea become more noticeable, this month signifies the end of summer, and beginning of autumn.<br>Second Harvest<br>
Sixth month of the year, marked by the gathering of resources and another harvest before winter sets in.<br>Sunfade<br>
Seventh month of the year, as the sun fades and rainy season sets in, this month is marked by abundant coastal precipitation.<br>Mistrend<br>
Eighth month of the year, characterised by the season's capacity to shroud and renew the land.<br><br>A full year on Caitha takes 296 days, or 8 months. Every season is roughly two months long.]]></description><link>timelines\time-and-the-calendar.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Timelines/Time and the Calendar.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hexenmeister]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 15:57:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><img alt="logo.png" src="\_attachments\logo.png" style="width: 650px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>Welcome to Caitha, dear reader.<br>
This worldbuilding project has been and still is a great journey that began in 2020, but has its roots in my childhood fascination with worldbuilding.<br>
I can trace this fascination back to about the age of 7, where my early attempts at map-making gave birth to many Island Nations, each proudly bearing the name "Joshuania".<br>
These miniature realms, with their train stations, sun-kissed beaches and grocery stores were my 7-year-old-self's vision of the perfect country, led, of course, by none other than me.<br>Now, with Caitha, my ambition has evolved. My goal is to breathe life into the fantasy world that has been brewing in my notes over the years, a world teaming with magic, history, and untold adventures. Caitha isn't just a static creation; it's a canvas for stories I might tell, a potential stage for epic quests in games like DnD or Pathfinder, or a backdrop for stories in whatever types of mediums I want to explore.<br>But even if I never venture beyond chronicling the history or writing about flora and fauna of Caitha, that's perfectly fine. The real joy for me at the moment lies in the act of building, in creating, in getting lost in the tapestry of this world, which is, in my mind, a lot more than I am currently capable of writing down.<br>So, whether you're here to explore or because I sent you the link eager to get some feedback on if the site is finally working or not:<br>
