 <br><img alt="logo.png" src="\_attachments\logo.png" style="width: 650px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>Welcome to Caitha, dear reader.<br>
This worldbuilding project has been and still is a great journey that began in 2018, but has its roots in my childhood fascination with worldbuilding.<br>
I can trace this fascination back to about the age of 7, where my early attempts at map-making gave birth to many Island Nations, each proudly bearing the name "Joshuania".<br>
These miniature realms, with their train stations, sun-kissed beaches and grocery stores were my 7-year-old-self's vision of the perfect country, led, of course, by none other than me.<br>Now, with Caitha, my ambition has evolved. My goal is to breathe life into the fantasy world that has been brewing in my notes over the years, a world teaming with magic, history, and untold adventures. Caitha isn't just a static creation; it's a canvas for stories I might tell, a potential stage for epic quests in games like DnD or Pathfinder, or a backdrop for stories in whatever types of mediums I want to explore.<br>But even if I never venture beyond chronicling the history or writing about flora and fauna of Caitha, that's perfectly fine. The real joy for me at the moment lies in the act of building, in creating, in getting lost in the tapestry of this world, which is, in my mind, a lot more than I am currently capable of writing down.<br>So, whether you're here to explore or because I sent you the link eager to get some feedback on if the site is finally working or not:<br>

 <br>The Dwarves of Caitha are widely credited with creating the first unified currency in the world, laying the foundation for the economy for centuries to come.<br>
The Dwarven Crown, commonly referred to as just "Crown", the most enduring symbol of trade and wealth. These hexagonal coins, produced in the golden halls of <a data-href="Dhartahl" href="\Dhartahl" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dhartahl</a> have long been the predominant currency used throughout the diverse regions of Caitha.<br><br>Crowns minted in the forges of Dhartahl are hexagonal with a hexagonal hole in the middle. They are approximately 3.5 centimeters in diameter, and have a 5 mm thick border with fine stripes in the middle. Many coins are simple, but some of the golden coins have a symbol printed on them to commemorate an event or important person.<br>
<img alt="goldencrown.png" src="\lib\media\goldencrown.png"><br><br>The copper crown (CC), the silver crown (SC) and the golden crown (GC) are the primary denominations of this currency. 10 Copper Crowns make a silver crown, and 10 silver crowns make a golden crown.<br>
Copper Crowns, often referred to as "Coppers," serve as the basic unit of currency for everyday transactions. Silver Crowns, or "Silvers," are of higher value and commonly used for larger purchases, while Golden Crowns, known as "Goldens," are the most valuable you will encounter in your day to day. There are Platinum coins as well, though they are typically reserved for significant transactions and wealth storage.<br><br>The origins of the Crown can be traced back to the ancient forges of Dhartahl, where Dwarven metallurgists and craftsmen created these hexagonal coins during the <a data-href="Empire Wars" href="\Empire Wars" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Empire Wars</a> in an effort to create an economy that would be much stronger than that of their enemies - with success.<br>
The unification of these coins into a single currency system was a remarkable achievement in a world that had previously relied on a hodgepodge of barter systems and various forms of currency. The Dwarves' reputation for integrity and craftsmanship bolstered the acceptance of their coins among other civilizations.<br>
Centuries have passed since the Dwarven Crowns were first minted, yet they remain the backbone of Caitha's economic stability. The enduring trust in these coins is a testament to the unwavering commitment of the Dwarves to maintain the purity of their currency. Each Crown is carefully casted and pressed in Dhartahl, adhering to the traditional methods passed down through generations.]]></description><link>economics\currency\dwarven-crowns.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Economics/currency/Dwarven Crowns.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 22:45:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib\media\goldencrown.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="lib\media\goldencrown.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Continents]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br>The story of the Druidic Sacrifice is the story of perhaps the single most pivotal and solemn event in the annals of the known world, marking the end of the <a data-href="Era of Storms" href="\Era of Storms" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Era of Storms</a>. <br>In a time before the "<a data-href="Era of Legends" href="\timelines\era-of-legends.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Era of Legends</a>" and the widespread adoption of the <a data-href="Druidic Calendar" href="\Druidic Calendar" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Druidic Calendar</a> that we use today, Mages wielded the extraordinary ability to manipulate the world's weather through a potent form of magic. These wielders of natural forces sought to shape the world's climate, bringing about significant changes that, while awe-inspiring, led to unforeseen and dangerous consequences.<br>The unintended side effect of the Mages' extensive use of magic was the emergence of <a data-href="Highstorms" href="\Highstorms" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Highstorms</a>. These storms bore little resemblance to conventional storms, replacing lightning flashes with disconcerting moments of darkness and the deep, rolling thunder with high-pitched, eerie sounds.<br>
These storms disrupted the world's natural order and posed a severe threat to all of the known world. Many mages did not realise this, or were simply too hungry for power. Magic users split into two factions, the mighty mages continuing to wield the uncontrollable destructive forces, and the Druids, wanting to save the world from certain doom. They were quick to realize the gravity of their actions, as the number of Highstorms grew uncontrollably, endangering both the physical and metaphysical realms.<br>Brutal magical wars ensued, claiming more lives than we could count today on both sides, but in the end, the Druids emerged victorious.<br>Faced with the dangerous consequences to the degree of manipulation the natural world has seen, the Druid Circles recognized the need for a momentous and collective effort to rectify their past misdeeds. With unity and a deep commitment to protect their world, they embarked on a secretive and large-scale ritual to banish the Highstorms far beyond the borders of the known world.<br>However, this ritual came at an extraordinary cost. Every Druid involved in this endeavour succumbed to exhaustion, marking their sacrifice with their lives.<br>The Druids, who later established the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Time and the Calendar" data-href="Time and the Calendar" href="\timelines\time-and-the-calendar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Druidic Calendar</a>, used this event as its official beginning.<br>Druids today regard the event as a crucial part of their heritage, and they have sworn to preserve Caitha as it is, ensuring the Highstorms remain at bay and refraining from further interference with the world's climate. Every new Druid is brought up with the knowledge that this great sacrifice may one day be required again.<br>In all parts of the world this degree of weather manipulation is outlawed today, and almost everywhere under penalty of death.<br>Nobody really knows what lies beyond the storms that encircle the world, and we may never find out.]]></description><link>historical-elements\legends-and-tales\the-druidic-sacrifice.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Historical Elements/Legends and Tales/The Druidic Sacrifice.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 11:41:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Legends and Tales]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>The Dwarves are an ancestry that shares a common ancestor with Humans and Gnomes, and that has inhabited the mountainous regions of the world for a long while. They have long been and to this day still are largely organised in Clans, a substitute for families.<br><br><br>Dwarves have a short and stocky build, standing shorter than humans, with wide, compact bodies and burly frames. Both male and female dwarves have evolved to grow thick bears that can act as a filter for the rough and dusty air deep within the mountains. Dwarves can live up to around 350 years old, and is considered an adult at the age of 50.<br><br>The murder of one dwarf by another is seen as the most atrocioous and terrible crime a dwarf can commit. For this reason, there is no death sentence among Dwarvenkind. Instead, murderers are exiled.<br><br>Dwarves don't have classic family constructs, and their last names are the names of their clans. Ofte times, within a clan, many dwarves are already related, so dwarves marry and migrate to other clans if they so please. When two dwarves have a child, it is assigned a so-called protector from their clan, because it is believed to be unhealthy for a child to only ever be raised by their own parents. The protector then takes on a lot of the work that comes with raising said child. A clan's bond is very close, and humans often compare them to large families. <br><br>Dwarves believe in a pantheon of gods and have a rich <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dwarvish Mythology" data-href="Dwarvish Mythology" href="\religions\gods\dwarvish-mythology.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">mythology</a> surrounding them.<br>
In larger cities, priests are usually appointed by the priestly order of their patron god to oversee places of worship. Core values that can be found with any god are good work, and the preservation of ancient dwarvish history.<br><br>Typical foods one would find in dwarven establishments are <a data-href="Ironroot" href="\flora\other\ironroot.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ironroot</a>, goat cheese and bread, the  staples of dwarven food. Living in the mountains, goats are the natural livestock dwarves have domesticated, so goat milk, meat and cheese are the most common ingredients in their cuisine. Ironroot, a native plant to the mountains, chicory, wheat grass and mushrooms even grow underground, and compliment their foods fabulously.<br><br>Dwarves typically introduce themselves by their first name and clan, followed by any titles or honorifics they might have. Their names usually contain hard consonants and typically are 2-3 syllables long.<br><br>First Names<br>
Agna, Bodill, Dolgrin, Edrukk, Grunyar, Ingra, Kazmuk, Kotri, Lupp, Morgrym, Rogar, Rusilka, Torra, Yangrit<br>
Clan Names<br>
Ahnlogryk (meaning "from the mountain's lake."), Padhemvok ("forest-born"), Jarrnryt ("Sunburst"), Elrumarak ("Diamond-made")<br><br>For dwarves, the 50th birthday holds an  important meaning. After fifty years, they cross the boundary to adulthood. While of course every day worth celebrating has a big feast, what makes the 50th special is the ritual that is performed. Every child gets a special, hand-made metal trinket by their protector at birth. At the ritual to adulthood, both the protector and the now adult dwarf will throw their trinkets into a forge, melting the metals down once again to mark the end of their bond, and the beginning of the adult life of the dwarf. The molten metal from the trinket is typically cast into an ingot, and treasured until the young dwarf becomes a protector themselves.<br><br>When dwarves have a disagreement they can not or don't want to settle with words, it results in a duel. Now, a duel must be agreed upon by both fighting parties, and a third neutral one. They will agree on weapons, from fists in unarmed combat to axes and hammers, and how long will be fought. This can be from drawing first blood, from knocking someone unconscious or just off their feet, until someone gives up or even dies.<br>
This is the only legal way for a dwarf to kill another dwarf, but of course it always comes with the risk of being killed yourself.<br>
Duels happen fairly often, though normally they don't go all the way until someone dies. They are fought to settle disagreements, to make out a new leader or find a successor, or just to blow off some steam. <br><br>Hit points: 10<br>

They also relied on hunting and gathering for their sustenance, although hunting was the more successful way of maintaining their diet.  Eventually, they discovered fire by striking flint against rocks, and it quickly became a valuable resource for warmth, food and metalworking.<br>
With readily available materials all around them, Dwarves became excellent miners, stoneworkers and smiths. As time went on, they carved more and more elaborate homes into the mountainsides and cliff faces. This is also the time, where their first writings emerged.<br>
With the discovery of fire, metalworking and the trade among tribes, Dwarves formed a large community and complex social structure, with rulers and a system of laws. They also established a writing system, at first occurring only on stone tablets, and on their walls.<br><br><br>The ancient city of <a data-href="Hrotmaerahn" href="\Hrotmaerahn" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Hrotmaerahn</a> (translated literally to "Old Sky Mountain") was the earliest city to emerge from Dwarvenkind.  During the <a data-href="Era of Storms" href="\Era of Storms" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Era of Storms</a>, Hrotmaerahn began to grow rapidly in population as a bastion against the <a data-href="Highstorms" href="\Highstorms" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Highstorms</a> that plagued the surface.<br>
The exact founding date of Hrotmaerahn has been lost to time. As it grew, Dwarves began to develop trade relationships outside of the city, with other Dwarven cultures and settlements, exchanging knowledge, valuable metals and Stoneworks for goods and resources. With the discovery of <a data-href="Moonstone" href="\resources\gemstones\moonstone.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Moonstone</a>, a gemstone that collects and keeps the moons light within for a considerable amount of time, their advancements into the depths of mountains went even further.<br><br>According to Dwarven legend, the discovery of <a data-href="Runebinding" href="\Runebinding" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runebinding</a> was a fortunate accident. It is said that a group of Dwarves were exploring the depths of a mountain cave near <a data-href="Hrotmaerahn" href="\Hrotmaerahn" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Hrotmaerahn</a> when they came across a peculiar set of glowing symbols etched into the stone. Not knowing what they were, the Dwarves touched the symbols and were immediately infused with magical energy.<br>
Excited by this newfound power, the Dwarves began to experiment with the symbols, carving them into stone and metal and imbuing them with different magical properties. Over time, they discovered that by combining different runes and binding them to anchors, they could create powerful spells that allowed them to do many things like teleporting, or creating powerful wards and enchantments. Yet another growth spurt in the development and history of the Dwarves.<br>
As their mastery of Runebinding grew, so too did their reputation as master craftsmen. They began to craft magical artifacts of immense power.]]></description><link>player-character-options\ancestries\dwarves.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Player Character Options/Ancestries/Dwarves.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2024 09:49:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Time and the Calendar]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>A single day on Caitha is roughly the same length as one on Earth. Time is being tracked throughout the day using a combination of sun-positioning, stable candles, water clocks, other mechanical or magical means and - depending on where you live - even using the weather.<br>
Mechanical clocks are technically available, though scarce, not very practical, and incredibly expensive.<br><br>The most widely adapted and established Calendar in Caitha is the <a data-href="Druidic Calendar" href="\Druidic Calendar" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Druidic Calendar</a> - a lunar calendar based on the moon phases of two out of the three <a data-href="Moons" href="\Moons" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Moons</a> of Caitha, Elydd, Nevi and Yova, developed by Druids in today's <a data-href="Ilora" href="\Ilora" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ilora</a> based on their observance of the night sky and the seasons.<br>
